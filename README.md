TRTabView
=========

**What it is**

TRTabView is a set of classes for iOS that implement a tab bar similar to the one seen in Mobile Safari. 

**How to use it**

It provides a flexible yet easy to use API which should look familiar to anybody who ever worked with a UITableView delegate and data source. Please check the sample app that comes with the project.
